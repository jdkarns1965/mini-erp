# Manufacturing ERP Setup Guide

## Quick Start (Database Setup Required)

Your development environment is ready! Here's how to complete the setup:

### 1. Database Setup

The MySQL database needs to be initialized. You have two options:

#### Option A: Manual Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Access MySQL (you'll need the root password)
mysql -u root -p

# Create database and user
CREATE DATABASE mini_erp CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'mini_erp_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure123!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mini_erp.* TO 'mini_erp_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
USE mini_erp;

# Import the schema
SOURCE /var/www/html/mini-erp/database/migrations/002_manufacturing_erp_schema.sql;
```

#### Option B: Update Environment File
Edit `/var/www/html/mini-erp/config/.env` with your MySQL root password:
```
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=your_mysql_root_password
```

Then run: `cd /var/www/html/mini-erp/database && php setup_database.php`

### 2. Access the System

1. **Visit:** http://localhost/mini-erp/public/
2. **Login:** 
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. **Important:** Change the default password immediately!

### 3. GitHub Repository Setup

Create your GitHub repository:
```bash
# Create repository on GitHub (private recommended)
# Then add remote and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/mini-erp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
